			<p>A contact manager is a software program that enables users
						to easily store and find contact information, such as names,
						addresses, and telephone numbers. They are contact-centric
						databases that provide a fully integrated approach to tracking all
						information and communication activities linked to contacts.
						Simple ones for personal use are included in most smartphones. The
						main reference standard for contact data and metadata, semantic
						and interchange, is the vCard.</p>
			<p>Sophisticated contact managers provide calendar sharing
						features and allow colleagues to access the same database. The
						main reference standard is the vCalendar.</p>
